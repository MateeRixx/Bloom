# Bloom — Classical CV Skin Image Analysis

Upload a facial skin photo and get a **rule-based classical computer-vision**
analysis of **acne**, **redness** and **blemishes**, with a side-by-side view of a
naive baseline and an improved detection pipeline.

> **Bloom is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
> Consult a dermatologist for skin concerns.**
>
> This is not an AI/ML model and not a diagnostic device. Detection is a set of
> hand-tuned image-processing rules; accuracy is not established.

## What it does

1. Upload a JPEG/PNG (max 10 MB) from files, drag-drop, or the device camera.
2. Validate the image safely (format, dimensions, pixel budget) and check
   brightness/sharpness.
3. Detect one face with MediaPipe FaceMesh; strict mode rejects images without
   usable landmarks.
4. Segment skin (YCrCb + HSV), exclude eyes/lips/brows/nose, and run the
   detection pipeline.
5. Return annotated images, `Clear`/`Mild`/`Moderate`/`Severe` bands, component
   counts, and a relative extent score.
6. Show a visual baseline-vs-improved comparison. **No accuracy metrics are
   shown for unlabelled uploads**; independent metrics live in the offline
   evaluation workflow.

No database. No accounts. No images stored — everything is processed in memory
and discarded.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React 18 + Vite + Tailwind)
      │  POST /api/analyse  (multipart/form-data)
      ▼
FastAPI (Python 3.11, synchronous)
      ▼
Classical CV pipeline (OpenCV, scikit-image, scipy, MediaPipe, numpy)
      ▼
In-memory result → base64 images + JSON
```

### Pipeline steps

```
1. preprocessing        dimension/pixel validation, decode, BGR→RGB, 512×512, brightness/blur gate
2. enhancement          LAB L illumination normalisation + CLAHE + bilateral
3. skin_segmentation    FaceMesh oval (strict), YCrCb+HSV skin mask, ROI erosion, exclusions
4. frequency_decomp     spatial LP / HP / DoG bands + LAB
5. lesion_detection     redness (LAB-A), blemish (LAB-L), acne (DoG) + watershed
6. postprocessing       morphology, min-area filter, region props, Clear/severity, extent score
7. visualization        annotated overlays → base64 JPEG
```

## Local development

**Backend** (Python 3.11):

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
copy .env.example .env                             # then edit if needed
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend** (Node 18+):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
copy .env.example .env                             # VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm run dev                                        # http://localhost:5173
```

Module CLIs require an explicit image path:

```bash
cd backend
python -m src.lesion_detection path/to/test.jpg
python -m pipeline path/to/test.jpg
```

---

## Tests, lint, and CI

```bash
cd backend
ruff check .
pytest
```

Current local result: `ruff check .` passes; `pytest` passes 57 tests.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs backend lint/tests and the frontend build.

---

## Independent evaluation

Ground truth must be **manual or licensed**, never derived from predictions.

```bash
cd backend
python -m evaluation.annotate_template --image-id img_001
# paint evaluation/ground_truth/img_001_{acne,redness,blemish}.png at 512x512
# set annotation_status=annotated in evaluation/manifest.csv
python -m evaluation.run_evaluation --dataset evaluation --out evaluation/results/run_001
```

Outputs: `metrics_per_image.csv`, `summary.json` (macro mean/median, support,
excluded undefined values), `status.json`, predictions. If no annotated images
exist, the runner writes a `pending` status and **does not fabricate metrics**.
See `backend/evaluation/README.md` and `docs/dataset-and-annotation.md`.

---

## DIP experiments

```bash
cd backend
python -m experiments.dip_experiments --out experiments/output
# or with an image:
python -m experiments.dip_experiments --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Synthetic restoration uses the clean scene as reference, so PSNR/SSIM are valid
there. Real-image enhancement reports reference-free entropy/contrast only. No
detection accuracy is claimed without independent masks. See
`docs/evaluation-report.md`.

---

## API

```
GET  /              → {"name":"Bloom API","version":"1.0"}
GET  /api/health    → {"status":"ok"}
POST /api/analyse   → multipart/form-data, field "file" (JPEG/PNG, ≤10MB)
```

**200**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "processing_time_sec": 1.23,
  "quality": {"passed": true, "issues": []},
  "detection": {"face_detected": true, "landmarks_available": true,
                "fallback_used": false, "model": "mediapipe_face_mesh"},
  "images": {"original": "...", "enhanced": "...", "skin_mask": "...",
             "baseline_annotated": "...", "improved_annotated": "..."},
  "concerns": {
    "acne": {"severity": "Clear", "count": 0, "area_pct": 0.0, "extent_score": 0.0},
    "redness": {"severity": "Clear", "area_pct": 0.0, "extent_score": 0.0},
    "blemishes": {"severity": "Clear", "count": 0, "area_pct": 0.0, "extent_score": 0.0}
  },
  "metrics": null,
  "metrics_note": "Per-image accuracy is not computed for unlabelled uploads...",
  "mediapipe_mode": "mediapipe"
}
```

- `severity`: `Clear` (no regions detected by the algorithm), `Mild`, `Moderate`,
  `Severe`.
- `extent_score`: relative area in `[0, 1]`, **not** a confidence value.
- `metrics` is `null` on uploads. Accuracy is computed only offline against
  independent ground truth.

**Errors**

- `422 invalid_image` — unsupported/corrupt/undersized/oversized upload.
- `422 quality_error` — brightness/sharpness failure; `quality.reason_codes` may
  contain `too_dark`, `overexposed`, `too_blurry`.
- `422 face_error` — strict-mode FaceMesh failure; `reason_code` and
  `detection.fallback_used=false`.
- `429` — rate limit (10 requests/min/IP).
- `500` — generic processing failure.

## Security and reliability

- Content-type → compressed size → magic bytes → Pillow dimension/pixel budget →
  OpenCV decode.
- Dimension limits: min side 200 px, max 6000×6000, max 24 MP.
- CORS uses an explicit, trimmed origin list (never `*`).
- Rate limiting is in-process (per worker, resets on restart), scoped to a
  single-instance deployment.
- Errors are generic to the client and detailed only in logs. Nothing is written
  to disk for uploads.
- Frontend requests have a 60 s timeout, AbortController cancellation, stale
  response protection, and object-URL cleanup.

---

## Privacy

Bloom does not store, log, or transmit photos to a third party. Images are
processed in memory and discarded after the response. No accounts, cookies, or
tracking.

---

## Deployment

`render.yaml` defines both services (backend web service + static frontend). Set
the repository in Render, update the `onrender.com` origins/URLs to your actual
service names, and deploy. In-memory rate limiting assumes a single backend
process; use a shared store if scaling to multiple workers/instances.

---

## Known limitations

- Rule-based classical CV, not AI/ML; no diagnosis.
- No labelled dataset is shipped; detection accuracy is **unverified**.
- One face only; no alignment/registration, multi-face handling, or occlusion
  modelling.
- Prototype thresholds may shift with skin tone, lighting, makeup, hair, and
  glasses.
- Acne `|DoG|` detection can flag highlights and can suppress weaker regions via
  a global-maximum-relative threshold.
- Runtime API deliberately withholds accuracy metrics for unlabelled uploads.
- A small annotated set would be a feasibility check, not proof of generalization.
