# DIP Methodology

This document records what each stage does, why it exists, its parameters, and
what it does **not** prove. All numeric parameters live in `backend/src/config.py`.

## 1. Acquisition, colour, and resampling

- `preprocessing.load_image_from_bytes` decodes with OpenCV and performs the only
  BGR→RGB conversion. All later modules receive RGB.
- Images are resized to `RESIZE_TARGET = (512, 512)` with `INTER_AREA`, which
  averages pixels when downscaling and reduces aliasing.
- Colour spaces:
  - **LAB** for luminance (L) and redness (A).
  - **YCrCb** and **HSV** for skin-range segmentation.
- Uploads are inspected with Pillow before full decode: format, minimum side,
  maximum width/height, and total pixel budget (`MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`).

Limitation: a 512x512 resize changes the effective lesion scale; parameters are
calibrated for this resolution.

## 2. Quality gate

- Brightness = mean grayscale intensity; reject outside
  `[MIN_BRIGHTNESS, MAX_BRIGHTNESS]`.
- Sharpness = variance of the Laplacian; reject below `MIN_BLUR_SCORE`.
- Face presence is **not** checked here. FaceMesh is the single face/landmark
  source; strict mode returns `face_error` when landmarks are missing.
- Reason codes: `too_dark`, `overexposed`, `too_blurry`, `no_face_landmarks`.

These are heuristic gate values, not calibrated quality predictors.

## 3. Enhancement

### Illumination normalisation

Shift the LAB L channel so its mean equals `TARGET_L_MEAN = 130`, clipping to
`[0, 255]`. Formula: `L' = clip(L + (130 - mean(L)), 0, 255)`.

### CLAHE

Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation on L only:
`clipLimit=2.0`, `tileGridSize=(8, 8)`. A and B channels are untouched, so hue is
preserved. CLAHE is a local histogram method; it can amplify noise and does not
guarantee better downstream detection.

### Bilateral filter

`cv2.bilateralFilter(d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)` smooths skin texture
while preserving strong edges. It is enhancement, not restoration.

### Alternatives (experiments only)

`histogram_processing.py` adds global LAB-L equalisation and gamma correction
(`GAMMA_CORRECTION=0.8`) for comparison. They are not in the production path.

## 4. Face ROI and skin segmentation

- MediaPipe FaceMesh returns normalised landmarks for one face
  (`FACE_MESH_MAX_FACES=1`). The face oval is filled as a polygon.
- The oval is eroded by `ROI_EROSION_PX=15` to avoid hair/background.
- Skin-colour mask = `inRange` in YCrCb **AND** HSV, followed by morphological
  open/close with an elliptical `(5, 5)` kernel.
- Eyes, brows, lips, and nose are filled from landmark groups and dilated by
  `EXCLUSION_DILATE_PX=5`; excluded from the analysis zone.
- `analysis_zone = skin_mask AND NOT exclusion_mask`.

Limitation: one face only; glasses, facial hair, makeup, occlusion, and extreme
angles are not modelled. Skin ranges are broad and not calibrated per skin tone.

## 5. Spatial band decomposition

On the enhanced grayscale image:

- Low-pass: Gaussian blur, `LP_KERNEL_SIZE=(21, 21)`.
- High-pass: `gray - low_pass + 128` (diagnostic; not used by detection).
- Difference of Gaussians: `G(sigma=1) - G(sigma=3)`, a band-pass blob response.
- LAB is computed for colour thresholds.

These are **spatial** filters. They are not described as FFT frequency-domain
processing.

## 6. True 2D FFT filtering

`frequency_domain.py` implements a Gaussian band-pass in the Fourier domain:

1. Convert to luminance `f(x, y)`.
2. `F = fftshift(fft2(f))`, with DC at the centre.
3. Build radial distance `D(u, v)` and mask
   `H = (1 - exp(-D² / (2·D_low²))) · exp(-D² / (2·D_high²))`.
4. `filtered = real(ifft2(ifftshift(F · H)))`.
5. Expose `mask` and a log-magnitude `spectrum` (display only).

Cut-offs are fractions of `min(rows, cols)`:
`FFT_LOW_CUTOFF=0.02`, `FFT_HIGH_CUTOFF=0.25`.

Validation: constant image → near-zero response; impulse → non-zero; in-band
sinusoid retains most RMS energy. This is a diagnostic/experimental path, not
currently part of lesion detection; no accuracy gain is claimed.

## 7. Gradient and edge detection

- `sobel_gradient`: Scharr 3x3 derivatives (`ksize=3`), magnitude
  `sqrt(Gx² + Gy²)`; other kernel sizes use Sobel.
- `canny_edges`: `CANNY_LOW_THRESHOLD=50`, `CANNY_HIGH_THRESHOLD=150`.
- `laplacian_map`: absolute Laplacian response for diagnostics.
- `edge_density(edge_map, region)` is used as a per-region feature.

Edge maps are not lesion masks. Synthetic step-edge tests verify response and
zero response on constant fields. Real-image sensitivity to hair, wrinkles, and
pores is documented as a limitation.

## 8. Thresholding

All thresholds are computed inside the analysis ROI.

- **Mean ± k·σ** (production):
  - Redness: `threshold = mean(A) + max(10, 1.4·std(A))`.
  - Blemish: `threshold = mean(L) - max(25, 1.5·std(L))`.
  - Rationale: adapts to per-image contrast; the floor prevents over-detection on
    uniform skin.
- **Otsu** (experiment): `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu` on ROI values only.
- **Adaptive mean** (experiment): OpenCV local mean, block size 31, C=5, ROI
  restricted.
- **Ratio of ROI maximum**: used by acne (`0.30 · max|DoG|`) and kept as the
  current production behaviour. This is sensitive to one strong edge/highlight.

Otsu/adaptive are not assumed to be better; they are compared in the experiment
runner and must be evaluated against independent masks before adoption.

## 9. Lesion detection

- **Redness:** LAB A above the adaptive threshold.
- **Blemish:** LAB L below the adaptive threshold.
- **Acne:** `|DoG|` above `0.30 · max(|DoG|)`, restricted to the zone, closed
  with a `(3, 3)` ellipse, then watershed-split.
- **Watershed:** distance transform → `peak_local_max`
  (`min_distance=10`) → keep peaks ≥ `0.4 · max_distance` → marker-controlled
  watershed with `watershed_line=True`.
- **Postprocessing:** morphological open, connected components
  (`connectivity=2`), drop regions below `MIN_LESION_AREA_PX=50`.
- **Severity:** `Clear` when area is zero; otherwise bands from unrounded
  `area_pct` (`acne 1/3`, `redness 4/12`, `blemish 2/6`).
- **Extent score:** `min(area_pct / Moderate_threshold, 1)` — relative extent,
  explicitly **not** detection confidence.

Known failure modes: bright highlights count as acne due to `|DoG|`; the global
max threshold can suppress weaker spots; hair and face boundaries can create
edges; parameter values are prototype settings.

## 10. Features

`features.py` computes per connected region:

- Shape: area, perimeter, circularity `4πA/P²`, aspect ratio, extent, solidity.
- Colour: mean L, A, B.
- Texture: GLCM contrast, homogeneity, energy, correlation (32 levels, distance 1,
  four angles); uniform LBP histogram entropy (P=8, R=1).
- Edge density from Canny.

Degenerate regions return zero or `None` rather than dividing by zero. Features
describe regions; they do not identify a medical condition.

## 11. Restoration experiments

- Corruptions: salt-and-pepper (`amount=0.03`) and Gaussian (`sigma=15`) on a
  synthetic scene with a clean reference.
- Filters: median `(5, 5)`, Gaussian `sigma=1`, Wiener `(5, 5)`.
- Metrics: PSNR and SSIM against the clean reference; entropy and contrast are
  also reported.

PSNR/SSIM are only valid here because the clean reference is retained. No
real-photo restoration quality is claimed.

## 12. Histogram comparison

Global LAB-L equalisation vs CLAHE vs gamma vs original. Reference-free entropy
and contrast are reported. Higher entropy/contrast is not automatically better.

## 13. Independent evaluation

- Ground truth comes from manual masks only; no prediction-derived GT exists.
- Baseline (fixed absolute thresholds on broad skin) and improved methods run on
  the same images and are scored against the same GT.
- Metrics: IoU, Dice, precision, recall, F1, with pixel supports.
- Aggregation: macro mean/median across images/classes; undefined cases excluded
  and counted.
- Results include dataset hash, config snapshot, software versions, and errors.

No baseline-vs-improved claim is made until a labelled set is available.

## 14. Limitations

- Rule-based classical CV; no learned classifier, no clinical diagnosis.
- One face, frontal-ish assumption; no alignment/registration.
- Prototype thresholds calibrated on the 512x512 enhanced representation, not on
  a representative labelled population.
- Skin tone, lighting, makeup, hair, glasses, and occlusion can change results.
- Runtime API returns no accuracy metrics for unlabelled uploads.
